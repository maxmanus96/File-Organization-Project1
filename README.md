# File-Organization-Project1
This project is about file organization. It was my first project for this lesson. Main points are timing and organization, sorting.

You can find the whole report about this project but it is in Turkish. You can see that it's about sorting, timing stuff.

Writing operations, reading operations, creating lists, editing lists, sorting by GPA, sorting by student number etc.
For timing operations used stop_watch().
